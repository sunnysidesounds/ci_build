ci_build
========

This sets up Codeigniter by downloading, creating css, javascript and ci view files. They allow for less configuration time. You can also set it to download jquery's latest as well.


To use you have a few options, run either:

```python ci_build.py``` (This will give you step by step on what you want to automatically setup and install) -RECOMMENDED

```python ciBuilder.py``` (This is pretty much the same things as ci_build.py but has no options and is constructed OO format)
    
```python class_ci_builder.py``` (Tester / development OO script, not used. But for references)
    
 
Note: This is still a work in progress.
